# Prototype Instructions

Run the local server yourself and open the preview in the browser available to this environment. Do not give the user server-start instructions when you can run it.

Before making substantial visual changes, use the Product Design plugin's `get-context` skill when the visual source is unclear or no longer matches the current goal. When the user gives durable prototype-specific design feedback, preferences, or decisions, record them in `AGENTS.md`.

When implementing from a selected generated mock, treat that image as the source of truth for layout, component anatomy, density, spacing, color, typography, visible content, and hierarchy.

Build app UI in `src/`. Keep `.openai/hosting.json`, `worker/index.js`, `scripts/prepare-sites-build.mjs`, and `tests/sites-worker.test.mjs` intact so the same local prototype can be handed to Sites. Before a Sites handoff, run `npm run build` and `npm run test:sites`; the build must leave `dist/client/index.html`, `dist/server/index.js`, and `dist/.openai/hosting.json`.

## Selected direction

The user selected the first displayed concept, Ink & Paper, as the starting point.
Source: `../../docs/design-concepts/ink-and-paper.png`. Preserve the warm paper,
blue ink, name-first masthead, editorial hierarchy, and prominent collections.
This folder is an isolated design prototype; it does not replace the production
Astro/TypeScript plan or authorize deployment. Keep its README and the repository
specifications synchronized. All sample content and generated photography must
remain clearly identified as illustrative until real content replaces them.
